# Task-3-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

## Dataset
Iris Dataset (from sklearn)

## Objective
To explore and understand the dataset using statistical and visual analysis.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## EDA Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Missing value analysis
- Histogram for feature distribution
- Boxplot for outlier detection
- Count plot for target variable
- Correlation heatmap

## Key Insights
- Petal features show strong correlation
- Dataset is balanced across species
- Sepal width contains minor outliers

## Conclusion
EDA helped identify important features for classification tasks.
